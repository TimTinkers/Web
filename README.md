An Unreal Engine back-end to read and visualize data collected by [Charlotte](https://github.com/TimTinkers/Charlotte).

I implemented this back-end entirely in Unreal Engine blueprints, and as such the code will be shared through images and links in this README file.

####Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the [VaRest plugin](https://github.com/ufna/VaRest), which made communication with a [RESTful database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) possible using Unreal Engine blueprints. Special thanks also given to [ArrestDB](https://github.com/alixaxel/ArrestDB) for providing a simple REST interface with a MySQL database.
